# Sastagram ( Social Media Website )

This application is made in Django and is very similar to Instagram.

## Features 
1. Post your favourite pictures or videos.
2. You can comment and like the post. And even reply to comment.
3. Users can create their new accounts and if they have their existed account then, they can login to their account.
4. Users can follow other users to see their posts.
5. If the users want to edit their profile they can also do that.
6. Users can upload their profile pictures and have to set their username 

which will be unique.

* NOTE : This application is in development stage so their will be bugs and 

has less features. 

* More updates will come in future :)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install 

require packages from 'requirements.txt' file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Move to that folder in which you have downloaded this repository and in 

that go to that folder in which 'manage.py' file is located.

2. There you have to run your server so that you can open the website. 

For running the server, open your command prompt in that directory and 

type the following command.

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
3. Your localhost server should start by now and just open your browser 

and go to url = 127.0.0.1:8000/ or click that blue text [localhost]

(http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

4. Just create your new account and you can explore the application.

* But at that time, you would be along in the website, for testing purpose 

create another account and have fun.

## Final Words
If you have any suggestions for improving this site, so make changes and 

if that is good then, I will merge that changes.

* This site is my first web application and it took many days in building this.

Thanks for reading till here :)
